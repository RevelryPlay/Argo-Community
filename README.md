# Argo Community Edition
An open-source version of the Argo game engine being developed by RevelryPlay

# Status
This project is in early development and is missing many of the critical components of a modern game engine.

# Background
After many years of playing games created by other people, I decided to start looking at building my own. 
At first, I wanted to use Unity, Unreal, or Godot, but the more I thought about it I decided that I could use this as an opportunity to improve my game development skills. 
The initial concept would have been written in C# but ultimately I decided this would give me an excellent opportunity to learn more C++ instead.

# Design Goals

For the first iteration, the current goal is to support building 2D narrative-driven / role-playing games. 
To support this goal, we will be building three separate systems:

- The engine itself
- An editor application
- An example sandbox demo project to showcase the engine capabilities

# Getting Started
This section is a work in progress and will be expanded on as we develop this project.
