# Argo Community Edition
An open-source version of the Argo game engine being developed by RevelryPlay

[Argo Homepage](https://www.revelryplay.com/Projects/Argo/) - [Argo Documentation](https://docs.revelryplay.com/argo/)

# Status
This project is in early development and is missing many of the critical components of a modern game engine. This means that while I have begun work on some initial systems there is not much to show yet beyond some simple drawing and texturing of shapes.

**This engine is built and maintained by a lone developer who is using this project
to learn C++, because of this many aspects may not be best practices.**

# Planned Release Frequency
While I do enjoy working on this engine, I am not able to devote as much time to it as I would like, as such I am planning releases to occur in two phases. 

- The first phase will be a closed source binary / library only release. These builds will be seen as unstable and will likely have different APIs then the open source releases. My current goal
is to do a closed source release about every month or two.
- The second phase will be here as an open source freely available release. These builds will generally be more stable and will be less likely to change APIs from release to release. My goal for
this release is about every three months.

# Background
After many years of playing games created by other people, I decided to start looking at building my own. 
At first, I wanted to use Unity, Unreal, or Godot, but the more I thought about it I decided that I could use this as an opportunity to improve my game development skills. 
The initial concept would have been [written in C#](https://github.com/RevelryPlay/Argo-CS) but ultimately I decided this would give me an excellent opportunity to learn more C++ instead.

# Design Goals

For the first iteration, the current goal is to support building 2D narrative-driven / role-playing games. 
To support this goal, I will be building three separate systems:

- The engine itself
- An editor application
- An example sandbox demo project to showcase the engine capabilities

# Getting Started
This section is a work in progress and will be expanded on as the engine gets closer to its first open source release version.
